# Narrator with Subtitles

A web app to help with language learning.

For some languages (like those of India other than Hindi), there are very few resources to practice listening skills.
Listening to everyday conversations or watching videos may be difficult for beginners
because natural conversations are fast, use a wide vocabulary, and may have non-standard accents and slang.

Some languages have good textual resources but not good spoken resources.
This is where Narrator with Subtitles can help.
It speaks out text using a text-to-speech engine and enables easy navigation across sentences in a lesson.
Other features:

* Adjust speech speed.
* See translations of sentences (if available).
* Transliterate among Indic scripts.
