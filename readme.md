# Narrator with Subtitles

_Narrator with Subtitles_ is a web application designed to aid in language learning.

For some languages (like those of India other than Hindi), there are very few resources to practice listening skills. Listening to everyday conversations or watching videos may be difficult for beginners because natural conversations are fast, use a wide vocabulary, and may have non-standard accents and slang. Often, only English subtitles are available, which helps people understand the meaning but may not be the best to understand what was said.

Some languages have good text-based resources (like Telugu and Kannada) but not good audio-based resources.
This is where _Narrator with Subtitles_ can help.
It speaks out text using a text-to-speech engine, and optionally shows the translation too.
This offers control over speech speed.
